In SMEC, As part of LAP. We need to digitize almost 30000 mouza-map and numbering them as their plot number. We use QGIS to digitise these maps and numbering them manually is an arduous task.
There are might be some some plugin like this. However, I need to reduce this time consuming task to automate.Then, I initially developed a python script and converted it into a plugin later
for better experience as well as added some feature such as undo feature.
